Feature: Flexmail
  As a Wagneer
  I want to be able to set up email configs
  So that we can create emailing forms

  Background:
    Given I log in as Joe Admin
    And I create Cardtype card "Testimony"
    And I create Pointer card "Testimony+*type+*send" with content "[[Testemailconfig]]"
    And I create card "Testimony+*type+*structure" with content
      """
      {{+name}} {{+email}} {{+Testimony}} {{+recipients}}
      """
    And I create Search card "search test+*right+*structure" with content "{"type":"User"}"
#    And I create Basic card "Testemailconfig"
    And I create Search card "Testemailconfig+*to" with content
      """
      {"referred_to_by":{"left":"_self","right":"recipients"}}
      """
    And I create Search card "Testemailconfig+*from" with content "{"left":"_self","right":"email"}"
    And I create Phrase card "Testemailconfig+*subject" with content "Subjectimus"
#    And I create Phrase card "Testemailconfig+*bcc"
    And I create Basic card "Testemailconfig+*message" with content
      """
      Pleistocles, {{_self+name|core}} says: {{_self+Testimony|core}} {{_self+search test|core;item:name}}
      buena,
      Thaddeus
      """

    And I create Phrase card "A+email" with content "argumus@test.com"
    And I create Phrase card "B+email" with content "tacitus@test.com"
    # FIXME: apparently cucumber or webrat or something can't handle saving
    # multiple line entries. Everything I've tried so far has resulted in
    # truncation after the first line.  which fucking bites.
    # so for now I will eunicize our tests and only check for one email delivery.
    And I create Pointer card "List1" with content
      """
      [[A+email]]
      [[B+email]]
      """
    And I log in as Joe User

  Scenario: Submitting a new Testimony
    Given I go to new Testimony
    When I create Testimony card "MoanE" with plusses:
      |name|email|Testimony|recipients|
      |Lee|lee@user.net|This is outrageous|[[List1]]|
    Then "argumus@test.com" should receive 1 email
    When "argumus@test.com" opens the email with subject "Subjectimus"
    And they should see the email delivered from "lee@user.net"
    And they should see "Pleistocles" in the email body
    And they should see "Lee" in the email body
    And they should see "This is outrageous" in the email body
