NOTE: the next GC person to do this - PLEASE add detailed commands where applicable!

To get set up for Wagn builds, you will need to:

1. Set up environmental variables.  eg, something like this in your .bashrc (or profile or whatever)

  if [ -z $CLDSTR ]; then
    export CLDHOME=${HOME}/dev/cldstr
    export CLOUDS=${CLDHOME}/clouds
    export SITES=${CLDHOME}/sites
    export CLDSTR=${CLDHOME}/tools/current
    export CLDCERTS=${CLDHOME}/certs
    
    export CLDKEYFILE=${CLDCERTS}/wagn.org.key
    export CLDCERTFILE=${CLDCERTS}/wagn.org.vendor.cldstr.com.crt
  
    export PERLLIB=${CLDSTR}/cldstr-tools/perl
    export PATH=${PATH}:${PERLLIB}:${CLDHOME}/bin  
  fi
  
  #FIXME - update this to use Gerry's .cldrc model

2. Set up directories to match your environmental variables settings
3. Get the cloudstore tools in your CLDSTR dir via subversion.
    #FIXME - add the command here
4. Get cloudstore certs and add them to the CLDCERTS directory (see above).  To do so, 
  follow instructions in cloudstore docs.
  
  #FIXME - add more specific doc references here.
   
  Note: To build wagn, you will need the cloudstore folks to give you those vendor permissions, 
  which means you'll need GC to sign off on that!
5. Install needed perl libraries
    #FIXME - add commands or references to cloudstore docs here.
6. Get accounts.json from GC folks or add your own Iaas accounts and generate account.json file.  Put it in the CLOUDS dir
7. Add an "apps" directory to the CLDHOME and clone https://github.com/wagn/wagn-cldstr.
    #FIXME add commands
  Make sure to get set up with write access if you're going to contribute code back.
8. run the following: 
    cd $CLDHOME/apps/wagn-cldstr
    git submodules update --init    # pull down the actual wagn code
    cd wagn/files-ws/web/
    mkdir tmp                       
    mkdir .bundle
    ln -s $CLDHOME/apps/wagn-cldstr/wagn/bundle_config .bundle/config
    cd $CLDHOME
    ln -s apps/wagn-cldstr/bin bin
9. install htaccess files with rake wagn:copy_htaccess
10. Test some things:
  a. add a cloud with cloud_add
  b. deploy a site with cloud_deploy.  there is a sample site in wagn-cldstr which you can get set to use by doing the following:
    cd $SITES
    ln -s $CLDHOME/apps/wagn-cldstr/wagn/cldstr_sample.json
    
Remember to update these docs with whatever you've learned!!
