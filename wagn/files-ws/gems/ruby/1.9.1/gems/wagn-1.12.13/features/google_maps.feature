Feature: Google maps
  In order to provide spatial visualization of Wagn Cards
  As a User
  I want to see a list of cards placed on a map

#  Background:
#    Given I log in as Joe Admin
#    # FIXME: this is creating a card with content '[[street address]]\n'  (missing zip)
#    #  test passes but this is weird.
#    And I create Pointer card "*geocode" with content
#      """
#      [[street address]]
#      [[zip]]
#      """
#    And I create Cardtype card "House"
#    And I create House card "Ethan's House"
#    And I create card "Ethan's House+*geodescription" with content "Welcome to Ft Collins!"
#    And I create card "Ethan's House+street address" with content "519 Peterson St"
#    And I create card "Ethan's House+zip" with content "80524"
#    And I log in as Joe User
#
#  @ignore
#  Scenario: I look at the KML for a search
#    When I go to kml source
#    Then I should see "Welcome to Ft Collins!"
